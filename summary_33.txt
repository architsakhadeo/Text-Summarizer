Faleh-Bader, director of the ambassador's office, said, `` We confirm there is an offensive at Kuwait border and we have no comment.
Department spokesman Richard-Boucher said Kelly repeated to the Iraqi envoy the US desire for a peaceful solution to the tensions with Kuwait and urged Iraq to respect to sovereignty of all nations in the region.
Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwait after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the OPEC cartel had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's revenue, and that Kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that straddles the border.
Iraq threatened to invade once before, in 1961 after Britain ended its protectorate over Kuwait.
Iraq then claimed Kuwait as part of its territory, but the appearance on the Kuwaiti side of the border of troops from Britain and other Arab states deterred further action by Iraq.
